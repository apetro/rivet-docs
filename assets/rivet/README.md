# Rivet
Rivet is a design system for use in UITS web application development projects. At its core, Rivet is a well-documented set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript assets. It is design to be used on interactive web applications with a focus on user experience, best practices and accessibility.

## Getting started
To-do:
- Add instructions about setting up .npmrc file
- Add instructions on how to download and use from npm or GitHub

## Whatâ€™s it for?
Rivet is *not* a replacement for the IU Web Framework which should be used for static content-driven informational websites. Rivet is meant to be used for internal-facing enterprise-level applications. If you're looking to build a departmental, or organizational website you should use the [IU Web Framework](https://framework.iu.edu/) and the [IU Web Style Guide](https://styleguide.iu.edu/).

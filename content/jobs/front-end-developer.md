## About the User Experience Office
The User Experience Office (UXO) at Indiana University takes a holistic approach to create simple, inclusive digital experiences. The UXO collaborates with university partners to help apply principles and best practices to their projects.

## The Role of the UXO Design system team

The role of the UXO design system team is to:

- Help create and insure design consistency, quality, accessibility across IU’s digital systems, and services
- Increase efficiency of design and front-end development by building tools that help designers and developers focus on solving problems instead of implementation details
- Provide training and resources to help all members of the organization increase their design fluency

## Requirements
As a front-end developer on our Design System team you will:

- Establish front-end patterns and practices that ensure accessible and highly-usable digital systems and services
- Work closely with designers to help grow our design system and keep it relevant
- Help refactor the codebase to make it more modular, scalable, and well-documented
- Help to make decisions about front-end technologies we’ll use to develop and evolve our design system
- Write clear, concise, and approachable documentation for every skill-level

**We are especially looking for candidates with the following**:

- Experience with maintaining and scaling design systems
- A thoughtful approach to design systems and front-end architecture
- Experience writing, and passion for, JavaScript. Although using frameworks like React and Vue will be a part of the Front-end Developer’s responsibility, we are looking for someone with strong knowledge of vanilla JavaScript.
- Deep knowledge of, and passion for writing modular, scalable CSS
- Passion for accessibility and performance


**Please provide example of your work including**:
- Pattern libraries or style guides you have created
- Github repositories with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS/Sass you have written
- Links to any visual design work you’ve done in the past
- Samples/links to any writing you may have done including documentation

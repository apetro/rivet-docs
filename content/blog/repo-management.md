Starting with the next release of Rivet, we'll be changing the way we manage bug reports, feature requests, and questions on the Rivet repos. Inspired by Lodash.

## The problem

The Rivet issues tab is cluttered. While some issues are genuine bugs affecting people's apps, many are feature requests, comments, or questions.

This clutter makes it difficult for us (and other contributors) to get a sense of the project's status at a glance. The high issue count gives the impression that Rivet is not as well-maintained as it could be, even though only a fraction of the open issues are show-stopping bugs causing problems for production apps.

There's also no way to see at a glance what feature requests have been made a priority by either the Rivet team or the community.

Having everything mixed together in the open issues tab makes it more likely that bugs needing immediate attention get lost in the shuffle and that feature requests get overlooked.

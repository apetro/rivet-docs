We've deprecated the [Rivet panel component]({{< ref "/components/layouts/panels.md" >}}) and will be removing it in the next major release of Rivet (`2.0.0`) in favor of two new components: the **box** and the **media object**.

## Box component
The upcoming [box component](https://codepen.io/levimcg/pen/XyVbeY) can be used to visually group related pieces of content. This new component has several display, sizing, and color variations, including a `.rvt-box--card` variant that can be used as a drop-in replacement for panels.

The box component is designed to be much more flexible than the panel component, providing developers and designers more options for grouping sections of content or displaying lists of related content.

You can [view a prototype of the box component](https://codepen.io/levimcg/pen/XyVbeY) on CodePen.

## Media object component
In addition to the box component, the next major release of Rivet will feature a [media object component](https://codepen.io/levimcg/pen/LXeLEP). Like the box component, the media object component makes it easier to display lists of complex content and their associated controls without the use of tables.

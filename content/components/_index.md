## Get started
The Rivet components documentation contains examples, code snippets, and guidance on UX best-practices. Visit the [**How to use**](../how-to-use) section to see all the ways you can use Rivet in your project and see some example implementations of Rivet.

### Download Rivet
You can download a ZIP file that contains the compiled and minified CSS and JavaScript, images, and a starter HTML file.

### CSS and JavaScript
The quickest way to get started with Rivet is using the centrally-hosted CSS and JavaScript files. [Read the Quick start guide](../how-to-use/quick-start) for more information.

Copy and paste this `<link>` element to `<head>` of your document. Make sure it is placed **before** any other stylesheets.

{{< code lang="html" >}}<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://assets.uits.iu.edu/css/rivet/0.2.0/rivet.min.css">{{< /code >}}

Rivet has a minimal amount of JavaScript that is required for some components, like the [header](../components/navigation/header). Copy and paste this link and add to the end of your document, just before the closing `</body>` tag.

{{< code lang="html" >}}<script src="https://assets.uits.iu.edu/javascript/rivet/0.2.0/rivet.min.js"></script>{{< /code >}}

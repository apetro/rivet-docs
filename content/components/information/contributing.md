## Github issues
We’ll be using Github issues to keep track of new component submissions, bugs, design feedback, and any other suggestions related to the design system. To help us understand the kind of contribution you want to make, we ask that you first [submit a Github issue on github.iu.edu](https://github.iu.edu/UITS/rivet-source/issues).

## Guidelines
Here are a few guidelines to follow when creating a new issue:

1. Go to the Rivet source repository on [github.iu.edu](https://github.iu.edu/UITS/rivet-source/issues).
2. Login with your IU username and passphrase. Don't worry if you've never logged into github.iu.edu before—anyone with a CAS username and passphrase can login and use the service.
3. Click the "New Issue" button.
4. Fill out the provided issue template to the best of your ability. If you are submitting a design concept for a new or existing component please attach a screenshot, a link to an Axure mockup, or feel free to link to example HTML/CSS/JavaScript (a link to a pen on Codepen would be great!). We’re looking for anything that will demonstrate your concept here. Don’t worry if it’s unstyled or lacks visual design.
5. After you have filled out the issue template click the Submit new issue button to create your new issue.
6. Once the issue is created it will move on to the review process.

## Github Resources

If you need more info, [this Knowledge Base article](https://kb.iu.edu/d/bagk) explains IU's Github Enterprise service in a little more detail and has some handy links to Git and GitHub documentation.

## Review process
Creating an issue is just a way to start a conversation that is visible to the whole team. Anyone should feel free to create a new issue, but before a new submission moves on to a formal review process we’ll ask that it include Each one include:

- a fairly short descriptive title
- What will be gained by adding this design and will be lost if we don't?
- A description of the design problem this component solves
- at least one of the following: screenshots/images of your rendered design, wireframes, design mockups, links to [Codepen](http://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), etc., Axure mockups, iPhone photo of a napkin sketch.
    - **NOTE**: If applicable, this should include a documented interaction flow, eg. states (hover, focus, click, drag...), error and success messages, etc.
- any other document, links, research you would like to include
- If you have a specific use-case for a proposed solution, please provide some context (screenshots, links)

### Collaboration

If you are a developer and want help with your submission from a designer make sure to mention that when creating your issue and someone from the review team will help pair you up with a designer. Same goes for designers that want help from a developer.

### Content changes
If you are proposing a content change, please include a draft of the text content you're focusing on.

### Proposed Status
After the Github issue is created and the submission has enough information and supporting materials (i.e., the issue template is completely filled out), someone from the team will mark the issue as _Proposed_. Otherwise, someone from the team will ask the submitter for further information/documentation and mark the issue as _needs more info_.

### Review criteria
Once they have enough info, the team will do a review of the proposed design based on the following criteria:

- **Usability** — Is the interaction flow clearly documented? Is the pattern responsive? Does it follow commonly accepted best practices?
- **Flexibility** — Does the component meet the greatest number of use cases possible? In other words, is this a common pattern that occurs in lots of applications, or it solving a particular problem in one application?
- **Accessibility** — Is the pattern accessible to all intended audiences?
- **Visual design** — Is the contribution consistent with our visual style?
- **Content** — Does the pattern have plain language, correct spelling, and grammar? Does the author clearly describe actions?

If the team decides to not move forward with the design submission, the issue will be marked as archived with an explanation of why.

## Our approach

### Start with user needs
* Write in a way that suits the situation. Ask yourself: Who is going to read this? What do they need to know? How might they be feeling?
* Help people find the information they need quickly and easily. Guide them through the process.


### Do the hard work to make it simple
* Use plain language and simple sentences.
* Choose clarity over cleverness.
* Be concise.


### Write for everyone
* Respect the complexity of our users’ experiences.
* Be willing to be surprised about who’s reading your work.


### Build trust
* Talk like a person.
* Tell the truth.
* Use positive language and concrete examples.

### Start small and iterate
* Make sure your content works for users. Don’t be afraid to scrap what’s there and start over.
* Write a draft, test it out, gather feedback, and keep refining.
